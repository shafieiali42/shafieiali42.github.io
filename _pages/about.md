I recently completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Sharif University of Technology [Top University in Iran](https://www.topuniversities.com/world-university-rankings/2024). My research interests lie in Trustworthy AI and Computer Vision, particularly at its intersection with Natural Language Processing. I am also interested in self-supervised learning and scenarios with limited annotated data, aiming to develop models that generalize well under low-resource conditions.

During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on diffusion models for text-to-image generation and vision-language Models. Prior to university, I was awarded a Bronze Medal in the National Mathematics Olympiad.

I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position to continue my research journey.
